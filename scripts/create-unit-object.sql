-- This SQL script creates the Unit object and its fields
-- You can run this if the UI continues to have issues

-- First, we need to insert the Unit object into core.objectMetadata
-- Then insert all the fields into core.fieldMetadata

-- Note: This is a template. The actual implementation would need proper UUIDs,
-- workspace IDs, and field configurations that match Twenty's schema.
--
-- For now, it's better to use the UI or wait for me to create a proper
-- TypeScript command script using Twenty's internal APIs.
